# About:
My puppet library. Some modules are experimental, others are fully functional, but in general they are simple classes that try to achieve their goals in a simple manner. 

# Modules: 

Java 6 and Java 7 for Ubuntu

Classes with some inspiration in [puzzle's puppet-java] (https://github.com/puzzle/puppet-java) and based in then update-alternatives command. 
To use, extract the jdk file from Oracle, create a tar.gz and put it in the files folder for the respective version. If the version is different from the one there, edit the deploy.pp  
Limitations:
  - You can't use both at same time cause they try to update a path updating file on profile.d. Use one at a time. 
  - When installing, all java binaries paths are updated, but binaries that are exclusive to a post/previous version will still point to that version (ex java-rmi.cgi) 
  - To make it fast, the files are copied in a tar.gz and extracted on site. This is a simple implementation that leaves the archive and a installation file in /var/tmp due to puppet nature.

Still an experimental class but working under certain conditions. The idea here is to provide a away to deploy a N node cluster that already as assigned tokens for that number of nodes. To do this you will have to have a variable 'servers' that contains the IP addresses of all nodes. 
Token assignment based on Benjamin Black token function.
